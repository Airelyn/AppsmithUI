### Welcome to Shift Scheduling App!

This is the final project for CS 3200 by G. Mackin, Airelyn Guadagno, Dhillon Murphy, Garrett Diegnan, and Melina Lymberopoulos. This is a sister repository for the AppSmith UI to [the main repository](https://github.com/Airelyn/24s-project-boilerplate) for creating the database, filling it with sample data, and constructing the REST API matrix.

Please judge participation based on commits to both repositories, as different group members were mainly involved in different areas of the project, and as such may not have made many commits to the repository that did not concern their main focus. That being said, while a commit may come from a single account, it does not mean they were the only person involved in the creation or design of the edits, as much work is done in groups despite being incorporated onto one system before being committed.

This app is built using Appsmith. Turn any datasource into an internal app in minutes. Appsmith lets you drag-and-drop components to build dashboards, write logic with JavaScript objects and connect to any API, database or GraphQL source.
